# Relation chaining in binary positive-only recommender systems

This repository serves as a companion to the paper submitted to Expert Systems with Applications.

The notebook [Functions.ipynb](https://github.com/rokgomiscek/relation-chaining-recsys/blob/master/Functions.ipynb) 
holds the functions needed to run the other notebooks.

Usage of our method is provided in four notebooks:
* [Recommendation-movies.ipynb](https://github.com/rokgomiscek/relation-chaining-recsys/blob/master/Recommendation-movies.ipynb)
* [Recommendation-radio.ipynb](https://github.com/rokgomiscek/relation-chaining-recsys/blob/master/Recommendation-radio.ipynb)
* [Recommendation-url.ipynb](https://github.com/rokgomiscek/relation-chaining-recsys/blob/master/Recommendation-url.ipynb)
* [Recommendation-Synthetic.ipynb](https://github.com/rokgomiscek/relation-chaining-recsys/blob/master/Recommendation-Synthetic.ipynb)

The notebook [Synthetic_parameters.ipynb](https://github.com/rokgomiscek/relation-chaining-recsys/blob/master/Synthetic_parameters.ipynb) 
evaluates 25 synthetic data parameter combinations using the code from 
[test2.ipynb](https://github.com/rokgomiscek/relation-chaining-recsys/blob/master/test2.ipynb).

It is possible to run these notebooks in binder:
